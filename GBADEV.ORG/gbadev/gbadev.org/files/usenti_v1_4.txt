Usenti is: 
- an bitmap editor for paletted (8bpp) images with nearly all the 
  capabitities of MS-Paint, plus a few extras like proper palette 
  editor (including a palette resequencer) and adjustable grid 
  settings for easy tile-aligning.
- using standard Windows-interface functionality like toolbars, 
  profile-settings, drag&drop and clipboard support.
- capable of exporting to GBA source code (C/S/ASM).

Usenti is NOT:
- a photo-editor. You're not supposed to edit photos at the pixel-
  level. You can try, of course, but I give no guarantees.
- expensive. In fact, it's absolutely free :).
- restricted to 8bit bitmaps. Though internally working with an 
  8bit palette, images at other bitdepths can be opened as long as 
  the number of used colors is 256 or less.

Usenti's primary purpose:
  To create/modify simple graphics where editing is done by the 
  pixel and easy control over the palette is essential. And we all 
  know how woefully inadequate MS-Paint is there.
  Initially intended specifically for GBA graphics, it should work 
  fine for other purposes (like web-graphics) as well.

Platforms:
  Win32. Found to be working smoothly on everything from 200 Mhz 
  laptop running Win95 to WinXP on a 2Ghz Athlon.

Usable image formats:
  BMP, PCX, TGA, PNG. 

Feedback:
  I'd very much like some feedback on this program, good or bad. This 
  is my first "real" program and I'd like to know if I'm on the right 
  track. Naturally, if you have ideas for improvements or found a bug, 
  I want to know about it.

PS: This is just a simple readme. For more details on features and how 
to work with Usenti, see usenti.chm.

PPS:  the GBA-export tool has just been rewritten to add more flexibility. 
I have tested it and it _should_ work as desired, there may be a few bugs 
left.
